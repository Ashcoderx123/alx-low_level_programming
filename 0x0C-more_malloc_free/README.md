#Project Overview:
##Malloc,Free,calloc.

This project is a completion of the previous project malloc,free as part of the SE program with alx language C.

Here we will work in more details of memory allocation and introduse the use of calloc(), realloc() and exit ()

##File Names:

for here the file names illustrate the type of function used in the program and what kind of tasks are required to be executed.

0-malloc_checked.c
1-string_nconcat.c
2-calloc.c
3-array_range.c
100-realloc.c
101-mul.c

#Project Requirements:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
